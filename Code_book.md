## Code Book. MD
1. You have to download source data from link below and unzip it to working directory of R Studio.
2. You have to perform R script.

## About source data
As source data for work was used Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## About R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" perform 5 of the following steps:   
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.   
  1.1 Reading files    
    1.1.1 Reading trainings tables   
    1.1.2 Reading testing tables   
    1.1.3 Reading feature vector   
    1.1.4 Reading activity labels   
  1.2 Assigning column names   
  1.3 Merging all data in one set   
2. Extract only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement   
  2.1 Reading column names  
  2.2 Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation   
  2.3 Making nessesary subset from setAllinOne   
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set   
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names   
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject   
  5.1 Making second tidy data set   
  5.2 Writing second tidy data set in txt file   

PS..The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

## About variables:   
* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
